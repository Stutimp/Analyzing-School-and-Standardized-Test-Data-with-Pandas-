# Analyzing School and Standardized Test Data with Pandas

## Overview
This project utilizes Pandas and Jupyter Notebook to analyze school and standardized test data for a city's school district. The objective is to assist the school board and mayor in making strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities by showcasing obvious trends in school performance.

### Analysis Details

**District Summary**
A high-level snapshot of the district's key metrics, including:

- Total number of unique schools
- Total number of students
- Total budget
- Average math score
- Average reading score
- Percentage of students passing math
- Percentage of students passing reading
- Percentage of students overall passing (both math and reading)

**School Summary**
A summary of key metrics for each school, including:

- School name
- School type
- Total students
- Total school budget
- Per student budget
- verage math score
- Average reading score
- Percentage of students passing math
- Percentage of students passing reading
- Percentage of students overall passing (both math and reading)

#### Performance Insights

**Highest-Performing Schools**
Top 5 schools by overall passing percentage.

**Lowest-Performing Schools**
Bottom 5 schools by overall passing percentage.

### Scores by Grade
Average scores for each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school:

- Math Scores by Grade
- Reading Scores by Grade

### Scores by Spending
School performance broken down by average spending ranges (per student).

### Scores by School Size
School performance broken down by school size.

### Scores by School Type
School performance based on the type of school.

**Tools & Techniques**
